  DESCRIPTION                   = "This file contains a table of the tiepoints
used to geometrically correct Voyager image C3490702_GEOMED.IMG from
calibrated image C3490702_CALIB.IMG. Tiepoints are organized in sets of four:
output line, output sample, input line, and input sample. The file was used as
an input to VICAR program GEOMA. The table has 552 rows, each containing the
four values in single-precision binary format. The table is padded at the end
with 24 unused rows to match the record length of the file. Note that line and
sample values typically range from 1 to 800, although some reseau markings can
fall outside these limits.

This file was generated using VICAR program RESLOC, running on a Compaq Alpha
under OpenVMS. This file is in Vax binary floating-point format; for
convenience, the same table of tiepoints can be found in ASCII format in
file C3490702_GEOMA.TAB.

Note: This file is provided primarily to document the processing history of
the images; users wishing to interpret this file will need to consult the
documentation and source code for VICAR program GEOMA. See file
DOCUMENT/PROCESSING.TXT for more information about the image processing."
